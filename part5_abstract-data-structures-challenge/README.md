# Review Abstract Data Structures

##Learning Competencies

* Understand the types of data structures.
* Implement data structures in Ruby.
* Determine when to use a particular data structure.

##Summary

You have now worked extensively with the Array and Hash data structures, and learned a bit about Stack, Queue and Linked List. For this exercise you will delve deeper into another data structure of your choice.


##Releases

###Release 0 : Dive in

There are over 40 student implementations of data structures in the `source` folder of this repo.

- Read through them to get a sense of the level of complexity of implementing one of these things.
- Notice that some are very simple while others are more complex.  There's a lot to learn here.
- Which solutions were your favorites and why?


###Release 1 : Pick one

Choose an **Abstract Data Structure** from
the list at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) (**not** Stack or Queue or Linked List), and do the following:


- Describe the major functions of the data structure in your own words in 3 or 4 sentences.

- Implement the data structure and its primary functionality using either an array or hash.

- Write assertions to show how your implementation works.

- Describe a 'real' programming problem that you would model with your data structure and how the model represents the problem situation without exposing unnecessary data or methods.


If you're feeling frisky, do it again.  Either better somehow or with a different choice.


###Release 2 : Go Public

Go exploring for public repositories that have data structures you can learn from.

Here are a few to get you started:

[This repo](https://github.com/kanwei/algorithms/tree/master/lib/containers) includes several Ruby implementations of data structures that might be interesting to study.

```text
deque
heap
kd tree
priority queue
queue
rb tree map
splay tree map
stack
suffix array
trie
```

[So does this repo](https://github.com/bvsatyaram/Ruby-Data-Structures/tree/master/lib/RubyDataStructures) with several differences

```text
multi dimensional array
doubly linked list
singly linked list
max heap
fifo stack
stack
queue
```

[As does this repo](https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster/tree/master/lib/hamster) with several differences

```text
hash
list
queue
set
stack
trie
tuple
vector
```
